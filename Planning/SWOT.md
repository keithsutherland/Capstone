# SWOT Analysis for "VirtuaFrame"

# Strengths
* Very honed and targeted to its audience.
* Provides information that other like apps do not (if implemented successfully...)
* The only app of its kind for the game/series.

# Weaknesses
* Probably won't be as well implemented as it can be.
* Will re-organize frame data from another site so, upon first viewing it could be confusing for long time viewers of the other site.
* Will not have a save feature for notes.

# Opportunities
* This field of app, while widely used, is not widely capitalized on. Given this I have many opportunities to implement many things that as a fighting game player myself, would like to see in an app like this. Like...
* Easily accessibly punish data.
* Eventually I would like to implement a saveable "notes" feature so a player can save character specific notes or whatever they think they need.

# Threats
* The fact that this info is accessible in other places, though not all in one place is definitely a threat.
* Any app that comes out that better implements the features that I have.
* Possibly poor responsive design as VirtuaFrame will mainly be used on mobile.
