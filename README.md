## Things I am hoping to learn in this course include
 ## a general proficiency with JS that includes..

 * A detailed understanding of Loops both while and for..
 * An ease of use with the CLI and VS Code.
 * A logical flow with Javascript that sees a fluency between the thought up concept and the actualization in the code.
 * An familiarity with the work flow of software development.
 * How to make my final project! lol
